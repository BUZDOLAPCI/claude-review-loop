First, set up the review loop by running this setup command:

```bash
set -e && REVIEW_ID="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$(openssl rand -hex 3 2>/dev/null || head -c 3 /dev/urandom | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n')" && mkdir -p .claude reviews && if [ -f .claude/review-loop.local.md ]; then echo "Error: A review loop is already active. Use /cancel-review first." && exit 1; fi && cat > .claude/review-loop.local.md << STATE_EOF
---
active: true
phase: task
review_id: ${REVIEW_ID}
started_at: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
---

$ARGUMENTS
STATE_EOF
echo "Review Loop activated (ID: ${REVIEW_ID})"
```

After setup completes successfully, proceed to implement the task described in the arguments. Work thoroughly and completely — write clean, well-structured, well-tested code.

When you believe the task is fully done, stop. The review loop stop hook will automatically:
1. Run Codex for an independent code review
2. Present the review for you to address

RULES:
- Complete the task to the best of your ability before stopping
- Do not stop prematurely or skip parts of the task
- The review loop handles the rest automatically
